2025-04-13 03:39:26,960 - INFO - Response: In 2018, the **gross enrollment ratio (GER)** for primary school students in Ghana was approximately **105.5%**, according to data from UNESCO and the World Bank. 

The GER can exceed 100% because it includes all students enrolled in primary school, regardless of age. This means that students who are older or younger than the official primary school age range are also counted, which can inflate the ratio.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or additional details!
